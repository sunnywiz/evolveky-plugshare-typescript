# evolveky-plugshare-typescript
Using typescript to get data from plugshare for use with evolveky

General Idea is: 
1) being able to get a list of our chargers so we can map them easily 
2) getting list of checkins so we can build an animation
3) possibly get other stuff around town like paid chargers vs free chargers
